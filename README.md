# Quoter model and contagion

We are investigating the impact of network structure (density, clustering, etc.) on information flow and comparing and contrasting with standard contagion models. The standard model for simple contagion is the SI model and other compartmental models (SIS, SIR, SIRS, SEIR, etc.), while the standard model for complex contagion is the threshold model and the independent cascades model . We are using the quoter model to simulate the creation of written information in online social networks. The model was first described in the paper
