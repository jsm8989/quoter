# Quoter model and contagion

We are investigating the impact of network structure (density, clustering, etc.) on information flow and comparing and contrasting with standard contagion models (simple, SI model & complex, linear threshold model). We are using the quoter model to simulate the generation of written information in online social networks. The model was first described in the paper
