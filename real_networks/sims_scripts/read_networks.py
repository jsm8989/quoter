# Note: Twitter,  Facebook, Gplus are ego-networks
# >>> very low density & clustering. very disassortative
# Bad:
# -Twitter (way too big, ego-net, not often cited)
# -Gplus (way too big, ego-net)
# -Club membership (projection, too small/dense, not often cited)
# -Blogs (too big, not "social")
# -Arxiv HepTh (too big, already have Arxiv CondMat)
# Meh:
# -Facebook (moderate size, but ego-net)
# -Highland, Sampson (signed), Prison (not often cited)
# Okay: seventh grade (high density), Taro exchange (small)
# Good: Highschool, jazz musicians, karate club, residence hall
